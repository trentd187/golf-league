/* global.css
   This file is the entry point for Tailwind CSS in the NativeWind setup.
   It uses three Tailwind directives that tell the Tailwind compiler which
   layers of generated CSS to inject at build time.

   NativeWind's Metro plugin (configured in metro.config.js) reads this file
   during the build process to generate the style definitions used by your
   components' className props.

   You can also add global custom CSS here (e.g., font-face declarations),
   though React Native support for arbitrary CSS is limited compared to web. */

/* @tailwind base — injects Tailwind's "Preflight" styles: a set of base/reset styles
   that normalize browser/platform inconsistencies so components render consistently. */
@tailwind base;

/* @tailwind components — injects any component class utilities (e.g., from plugins
   or your own @layer components blocks if you add any). */
@tailwind components;

/* @tailwind utilities — injects all of Tailwind's utility classes (flex, text-xl, bg-green-700, etc.).
   This is the largest layer and the one you'll use most in className props. */
@tailwind utilities;
