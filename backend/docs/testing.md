# Backend Testing

## Setup

- Test runner: `go test` (built into Go)
- Assertions: `github.com/stretchr/testify` (in `go.mod`)
- Shared helpers: `backend/internal/testutil/testutil.go`

```bash
go test ./...                                    # all
go test ./internal/handlers/ -v                  # one package, verbose
go test ./internal/handlers/ -run TestHealthCheck -v  # one test
```

## File conventions

- Test files end in `_test.go`
- Package name: `<package>_test` (black-box style — only exported symbols accessible)
- Test name: `func TestSubject_Scenario(t *testing.T)`
- Test files live alongside the code they test

## Tests required for every new handler

**Every new handler file must ship with a `_test.go` file in the same commit.** The coverage ratchet in `scripts/check-go-coverage.sh` blocks any commit that lowers total coverage. Do not use `LEFTHOOK=0` to bypass — write the tests instead.

Minimum bar: cover every validation path reachable without a real database (invalid UUIDs, missing required fields, out-of-range values). Those paths are the first code executed on any bad request, so this alone is enough to hold coverage.

## Checklist when modifying existing handlers/models

1. **Existing tests pass?** `go test ./...`
2. **New Tier 1 testable path?** New required field, new UUID param, new enum check that returns before a DB call → add a test.
3. **DB-level only validation?** Some constraints (Postgres enums, FK constraints) are enforced by the DB, not Go code. Document with a comment in the handler rather than leaving a test gap unexplained.

`ScoringFormat` is the canonical case 3 example: the handler casts the raw string directly to `models.ScoringFormat` and GORM sends it to Postgres, which rejects unknown values via the enum constraint.

## Two-tier test strategy

### Tier 1 — No database (fast, always runnable)

Most validation branches return before any DB call, so `nil` can be passed as `*gorm.DB` safely. Build the Fiber app inline:

```go
app := fiber.New(fiber.Config{DisableStartupMessage: true})
app.Get("/courses/:courseId", handlers.GetCourse(nil)) // nil service — UUID check returns first

req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/courses/not-a-uuid", nil)
resp, err := app.Test(req, -1)
require.NoError(t, err)
assert.Equal(t, http.StatusBadRequest, resp.StatusCode)
```

For JSON bodies, always set the Content-Type header (Fiber's `BodyParser` requires it):

```go
buf := bytes.NewBufferString(`{"name":""}`)
req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "/courses", buf)
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
resp, err := app.Test(req, -1)
```

Or copy the `doJSON` helper pattern from `courses_test.go` into your new test file — each test file is self-contained.

`testutil.NewTestApp` + `testutil.DoRequest` work for simple GET handlers (see `health_test.go`).

### Tier 2 — With database (integration tests, testcontainers-based)

`testutil.NewTestDB(t)` spins up an ephemeral `postgres:16-alpine` container per `go test` invocation via [testcontainers-go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/), applies every migration, and returns a `*gorm.DB`. The container is shared across all tests in the process (one ~5s cold start, then fast); each `NewTestDB` call TRUNCATEs every public-schema table CASCADE so individual tests start clean.

**Setup**: install Docker. That's it. No env vars, no manual `CREATE DATABASE`, no separate dev/test DB to manage. The pre-commit ratchet always runs Tier 2 — there is no skip path.

```bash
go test -count=1 ./internal/services/...
```

If Docker isn't running you'll see `failed to start postgres container` — start Docker Desktop and re-run.

**Tests using `NewTestDB` must NOT call `t.Parallel()`** — TRUNCATE is global and would race across goroutines sharing the same database.

The canonical example is `internal/services/course_service_test.go`.

### Tier 2 handler tests — for thin handler success/mapping paths

Handlers are Tier 1 by default. But a thin handler's success and error-mapping
branches (parse → `svc.Method(...)` → shape the response / `writeXError`) can't be
reached with a `nil` DB — the service call panics — so they stay uncovered. When
those lines need coverage (e.g. to satisfy SonarCloud's coverage-on-new-code on a
handler), add a **Tier 2 handler test** with a real service backed by
`testutil.NewTestDB(t)` on a bare single-route app:

```go
db := testutil.NewTestDB(t)
svc := services.NewCourseService(db, nil) // real service, no external client
app := newSingleRouteApp(http.MethodGet, "/courses", handlers.GetCourses(svc))
resp := doJSON(t, app, http.MethodGet, "/courses", nil)
```

The course handlers read no auth `Locals`, so no auth injection is needed. The
canonical example is `internal/handlers/courses_integration_test.go`. (SonarCloud's
coverage scope is aligned to these tiers — see the SonarCloud section in `CLAUDE.md`.)

## What to test (ordered by impact on coverage ratchet)

| Priority | Target | Tier | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Required** | Every validation branch reachable without a DB | 1 | `*_test.go` next to handler/service |
| High | Service business logic (happy + error paths) | 2 | `internal/services/*_test.go` |
| High | Permission helpers (`EventService.IsOrganizer`, `RoundService.IsOrganizer`) | 2 | `services/*_service_test.go` |
| High | Score entry validation (handicap gate, group membership) | 1 or 2 | service or handler |
| Medium | Handler happy paths (correct status + response shape) | 2 | service test (preferred) |
| Low | Additional error paths (404, 403) | 2 | service test |

### Layered convention (post course-service refactor)

New domains follow the layered pattern: handlers parse HTTP and delegate to a service in `internal/services/<domain>_service.go`. Validation, DB access, and external-API orchestration live in the service.

- Handler tests: Tier 1, focused on HTTP plumbing (UUID/body parsing, content-type, route wiring).
- Service tests: Tier 2, focused on business rules — validation errors, sentinel errors, transaction boundaries, happy paths. Wire external APIs to an `httptest.Server` via the service constructor's client (e.g. `GolfCourseAPIClient.SetBaseURL`).

Sentinel errors (e.g. `services.ErrCourseNotFound`, `services.ErrCourseInUse`) and `*ValidationError` are the contract between the two layers — handlers map them to HTTP statuses via a `writeCourseError`-style helper. **Note:** that helper returns `bool` (handled / not-handled), not `error`. Fiber's `c.Status().JSON()` returns `nil` on success, so an `error`-returning helper can't distinguish "wrote a response" from "fell through".

## Coverage ratchet

Baseline in `.go-coverage-baseline` (repo root, committed). Auto-updates upward when coverage improves; never decreases. Measured: `internal/handlers`, `internal/middleware`, `internal/services`.

Because Tier 2 tests run via testcontainers (no skip path), the ratchet measurement is consistent across machines — you cannot accidentally drop coverage by forgetting to start a database.

Before committing, run:
```bash
go test -count=1 -coverpkg=github.com/trentd187/golf-league/internal/handlers,github.com/trentd187/golf-league/internal/middleware -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep "^total:"
```

Compare against `.go-coverage-baseline`. If it drops, add Tier 1 tests **in the same commit** — don't rely on auto-update to paper over the regression.

**`-count=1` is required.** Go's test cache replays the coverage profile from the last run. If any instrumented file changed since the cached run, the merged `coverage.out` miscounts total statements (observed: 19.4% reported instead of actual 24.9%). `-count=1` disables the cache and forces a fresh measurement every time.

**`-timeout 180s` is required for the ratchet.** The default 60s timeout is fine when only Tier 1 runs, but the first Tier 2 test in a fresh process spends ~5s starting Postgres + applying migrations. Pre-commit uses 180s; ad-hoc runs can drop it back when iterating.

## Common Tier 1 patterns (no DB needed)

- `uuid.Parse(c.Locals("userID"))` fails when no auth middleware in test → returns **401**. Applies to: `GetRound`, `UpdateRound`, `DeleteRound`, `AddGroupMember`, `RemoveGroupMember`, and any handler that reads `c.Locals("userID")` first.
- `parseCourseID` / `parseTeeID` reject bad UUIDs → returns **400** before the first DB call.
- `IsConfigured()` check on `GolfCourseAPIClient` with empty key → returns **503** before parsing the body.
- `BodyParser` with `Content-Type: text/plain` → returns **400** when handler validates body before any DB call.

## When Tier 1 patterns do NOT apply (require Tier 2)

Any handler that calls `findCourse(c, db, ...)`, `findTee(c, db, ...)`, or `db.First(...)` before body or UUID validation — passing `nil` DB will panic. Document these gaps with a comment in the handler.
